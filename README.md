Plan:
Our group is planning to create an action platformer with enemies.
Bezier curves will be used for moving platforms and for attacks the player and enemies can perform.
The game will also have a leaderboards type of screen where scores will be saved and shown.
We also plan to add localization to relevant text in menus and UI.
